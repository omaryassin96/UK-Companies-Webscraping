Metal Spinning is a unique process that starts with a flat sheet of material. This is cut, either manually or laser cut, into circular form. Once this has been completed the “blank” or circular disk is loaded on to the metal spinning lathe.  The tooling is what gives the end component the required shape and is produced from technical drawings provided from the customer. The “blank” then rotates in a circular motion at speeds of up to 1250 rpm.  The lathe operator, also known as a “metal spinner”, then applies pressure through a “roller” or spinning tool. The metal spinner will apply a series of passes over the “blank” to form the material over the tooling. Through this craftsmanship the highly skilled metal spinner will produce a component that duplicates the exterior portion of the tooling it was formed on.In addition to metal spinning we aim to provide a complete manufacturing solutions to our customers.

DUPAL UK LIMITED,1-10 employees, "Our shower head scheme has been designed to substitute traditional deep clean and descaling that should be carried out in all healthcare and public facilities. The scheme allows hospitals, clinics, universities student accommodation and even hotels to fully protect their users and comply with the most rigorous guidelines.The simplicity of the scheme is also very attractive for any facilities manager: simply substitute both shower head and hose every so often (in the UK we do it every 3 months as per our guidelines called ACoP L8). Doing so means deep clean and de scaling never happens again, removing this way costs and risks associated with chemical storing and handing, dismantling, disinfecting and drying all shower heads and hoses.On each change both the shower head and the hose have a different colour code, allowing easy and immediate identification of the units, also removing the need for complicated and time consuming records, inventories and check lists.Overhall we find the cost of the scheme to be similar or lower when compared to traditional procedures, depending on the labour cost.We are looking for distributors to run our scheme that might already be working within water hygiene and healthcare and public facilities.Depending on quantities we can consider branding the scheme with your companies name and logo on it.This is a very interesting proposition under the business point of view for its repeating sales model and presents itself as a valuable differentiator your company can offer its clients and prospects over the competition.

HPS Product Recovery Solutions (Hygienic Pigging Systems Ltd),11-50 employees, "HPS are the world's leading process pigging and liquid product recovery specialists. Our pigging solutions are used across the globe in a wide variety of industries. These include food, beverages, cosmetics, personal care, household products, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, paint, solvents, pet food and many more. Generally, any manufacturing process that pumps liquids can benefit from pigging. For example, if you drink cola, other soft drinks, wines or spirits, or use shampoo, soap, toothpaste or shaving gel, eat ready meals, sauces, dips, or use household fluids, then you have almost certainly used something that’s been “pigged”. And probably by an HPS pigging system!Also known as “liquid product recovery”, pigging is a highly effective method of recovering nearly all residual liquids in pipelines. Rather than flushing good product to waste, pigging means you can continue to process it. This increases yields, speeds up changeovers and CIP, saves on water and cleaning chemicals and helps towards your company’s environmental sustainability credentials. So, the return on investment (ROI) from pigging is high with payback usually less than 12 months.Pigging systems work by propelling a specially designed projectile (called a Pig) through pipelines. The unique design of the HPS pig means it has extremely high recovery rates of up to 99.5%. As well as delivering exceptional performance, HPS pigs are safe, robust, flexible, bi-directional, fully detectable (but do not contain solid magnets) and long lasting. Each HPS pig has a long minimum lifetime guarantee. HPS offer a fully comprehensive range of services, from pigging system design, automation and software coding, to implementation and commissioning. We also deliver great technical support, customer care and after-sales services.HPS head office is in Nottingham, UK, with additional offices in the US, Australia, and a network of representatives throughout the world.For more information, contact HPS today!

OXFORD ADVANCED SURFACES LIMITED,11-50 employees, "While the adhesive bonding and coating of composites and plastics is well understood the challenge is in the necessary surface preparation and how to achieve this in a production environment, particularly in volume production.
Sanding, vapour blasting and other abrasion technologies do not easily lend themselves to volume manufacturing processes. Onto™ is a simple to apply chemical surface preparation based on unique patented technology originally developed at University of Oxford.
Surfaces can be prepared without the risk of damage, without the health and safety issues such as dust, and in considerable faster time; increasing production through-put and improving production efficiency. Where if it takes 30 minutes to prepare a bond line by abrasion, with sanding and cleaning, the same area can be prepared in 1-3 mins depending on whether it is prepared by hand or automated.
The Onto™ is applied and cured using standard, readily available equipment, so requires no large capital expenditure. While the time savings translate directly into cost savings.
Onto™ works for the surface preparation of all composites and engineering plastics, when using any form of epoxy and polyurethane adhesives, or paints and lacquers. It also allows dissimilar or difficult to bond materials, such as nylon or PEEK to be jointed. 
Once the surface is prepared parts can be used immediately for in-line production or produced in batches for later use.
Onto™ is suitable for surface preparation for adhesive bonding and for painting and lacquering.

With our core London Dry Gin we wanted to create a spirit which reflects the aromas of a walk out of the distillery, through the fields and into the woods. So expect sweet/floral and woody/nutty flavours. On the nose, aromatic citrus and pine give way to a full and complex warming sweetness on the palate.  A hint of nuttiness and a bump of spice carries through to the finish, complimented by a gentle floral, aromatic quality. Above all, it is a gin of remarkable smoothness with a luxurious silken mouthfeel.

SHAKESPUSS & CO LIMITED,1-10 employees, "The Tales of Shakespuss re-tell key elements of Shakespeare's plays so that they can be understood and enjoyed by the very youngest, from as early as when they can be read to, up until they begin exploring reading for themselves and more.  
Conceptually, William Shakespuss is a cute white cat with an uncanny resemblance to his master, William Shakespeare.  He hears the plays as Shakespeare writes them, and plays out his favourite parts of the stories with his collection of animal friends.  
The initial focus is on a set of picture books featuring these stories, full of the comical animal characters, each representative of a style of player within Shakespearean acting, and each named after one of the original Shakespeare troupe of actors.  In time the collection will run to a collection of around 25 stories/books, at the beginning of 2017 there are 3 published of the first set of 5.
The concept is to give children an understanding of Shakespeare in a soft, friendly way so that the cornerstone of literature is familiar and free from any concerns a child may have when encountering the works within a school environment when older.  Likewise, with the introduction of gaming and trails it is hoped that children will be encouraged to learn about Shakespeare and understand more about Stratford upon Avon, perhaps encouraging them to visit with their parents and relate to everything Shakespeare from their own perspective.
The books will be supported by a variety of merchandise, beginning with a plush toy of Shakespuss, available soon.  In time, with the plethora of animals to draw on, there is ample opportunity to create a dynamic range of toys and games which will grow the concept further still.
The website will gain a child-centric side, full of interactivity, ensuring that the whole world can be reach, entertained by, and be included in understanding and sharing a love of Shakespeare.

ARMSTRONG TEASDALE LIMITED,Retail and luxury, "Arnett Vintage Company is a husband and wife family run business between Daniel and Sarah Arnett. The story begins five years ago, when Sarah began collecting antiques and vintage artwork as a hobby, choosing one off, unique pieces that caught her eye. With a passion for all 1940’s and 50’s styling, and a first-class degree in Fine Art from York University, she began trading at small craft fairs and sales. Once she began this passion for vintage pieces grew and grew and she spent days and nights researching and learning all she could about the antique trade. As the family home slowly began to mysteriously gain pieces that were originally destined for sale (Sarah had a habit of keeping some little treasures), Daniel began taking an interest in antiques and began accompanying Sarah to sales and on visits to antique dealers across the country. Fresh eyes helped seek out new avenues of interest for them both, and they began dealing in antique picture frames, 3-dimensional artwork and small furniture. Sarah worked at creating shabby-chic distressed picture frames in a home workshop, and Daniel called on his years of sales management expertise to create a strong business identity and presence. From this, Arnett Vintage Co. was born. And from those beginnings of paint covered clothes and long nights of research armed with glasses of wine and laptops, the duo have now created a truly novel brand that brings antiques and unique vintage pieces to the homes of today.

ASPIRE CONSULTING AND TRAINING LTD,Financial and professional services, "Aspire has developed a revolutionary SAAS solution the Aspire Business Diagnostic Toolkit (ABDT) that helps organisations to rapidly solve business problems, accelerate decision making, and increase employee participation in the decision making process to improve buy-in, reach consensus and gain commitment and take ownership of the roadmap for change. Involvement strengthens their belief in the business and the change path chosen. The software enables helps your business to lay a continuous improvement platform across your entire Target Operating Model or to run tailored specific niche diagnostics. Our best practice functional diagnostics are provided as standard and you can build and tailor your own diagnostics for your own purposes.
Management consultancy firms charge £250K-£500K to run 8-12 week strategy/problem solving engagements, using a team of 5-6 resources to define a roadmap for change by conducting 50-100 interviews. 
The ABDT system achieves the same result in 10-15 days at a cost starting at £10K through to £60K typically (depending on support & budgetary needs) with a highly experienced 2 person team by automating both the interview process and analytical reporting. We capture maturity scoring of AS IS and TO BE responses in relation to key questions, as well as narrative input and video content to enrich the analysis.
ABDT allows time phased comparisons to measure whether change interventions have had the desired positive impact on the business and determine if your organisational change management (OCM) approaches are working or pin-point where they are not.
Large complex groups e.g. conglomerate, PE, VC can use the ABDT system to run portfolio comparisons across your entire group to rapidly identify who your leaders and laggards are. 
We would welcome discussions with prospective clients, and/or potential overseas business partners who are interested in offering our proprietary software based services to your own clients.

It works in all snow from a frosty light dusting, to deep heavy snow therefore lengthening the potential time for fun. Conventional sledges rely on runners, therefore will grind to a halt in deep or soft snow, and slush - Axiski will not and that is why it is even great on SandDunes in the summer, making the Axiski a great all year product. 
Our product provides more than one position, like the option to stand up or sit down or even share it at the same time with someone else.This versatility allows a parent and their child to glide down a slop together.
Durably designed - It was created with attention to detail and made to withstand tough conditions.

BANNER BOX LIMITED,Textiles, interior textiles and carpets, "Barbeline was founded in 2015 by University of the Arts London Pattern Design alumni, aesthete and self-confessed colour addict, Barbeline Lusandu, in her studio in East London.
Barbeline initially began her design career in 2012, producing quirky patterned childrenswear, “I have always had a passion for interiors, but when I first started designing the Scandi vibe of clean lines and minimalism was still very much the trend, so I decided to specialise in childrenswear, where fun is at the forefront. Friends would come to our home and say how much they loved the punchy patterns and colour we had in every room but were almost fearful of trying it themselves. I began making cushions and lampshades for them, and encouraged them to be bold, bright and try new things.”Interiors soon became a full-time job for the mum-of-one, whose vibrant new aesthetic gives her clients the opportunity to make their homes a space where they can assert their personality without hesitation. “Everything I design I would have in my own home. It’s all about colour, pattern and texture - there are no rules. Interiors should be fun and exciting and give you something to be happy about.” Just like the woman herself…

Our founder, Bay Burdett, was diagnosed with IBS in 2015, after years of suffering IBS symptoms and she was advised to follow a Low FODMAP Diet. The diet requires you need to eliminate foods high in FODMAPs (hard-to-digest ingredients), which can be naturally found in foods as well as found as additives. 
Bay soon realised there were few convenient, good tasting Low FODMAP foods available and having found out that now nearly 1 in 3 suffer from IBS type symptoms, and 20% of the world population are diagnosed with IBS, she knew she couldn't be the only one looking for the foods which don’t contain hard-to-digest ingredients, such as onion, garlic, lentils and wheat. After some market research and product development, Bay launched Bay's Kitchen and the first range of ambient stir-in sauces launched in April 2018. Fast forward a couple of years and we now have a range of 10 stir-in sauces and are soon to be launching new Low FODMAP, Gluten-Free gravies, stocks, soups and chutneys!

BEET LANGUAGE CENTRE LIMITED,1-10 employees, "Our first board game under the BeGenio series is called Race To Infinity, created to help children make maths fun, enjoy maths more, build social and analytical skills, spacial skills, decision making skills, creative thinking skills, critical thinking skills and increase maths confidence. 
The problem this very entertaining game, Race To Infinity, solves is that too many children hate maths and unfortunately experience maths anxiety, manifesting in form of faster heart rates, sudden breakout of sweat, stomach contractions, sadness and frustration.
BeGenio helps children and their parents view Maths differently. Grace, our founder, is a mother of two Mathematics-lovers as well. They weren’t born that way. She orchestrated some deliberate practice with them. Getting good at “numbers” is simply a skill, and any skill just needs smart practice. 
Our educational board games are innovative, fun and truly engaging, that create a unique playing experience that you will not find anywhere else, and at the same time that bring families and loved ones together to create stories that last a lifetime. The difference with our games is that we create games that possess deep play value; that is, they keep both children and adults wanting to come back to play over and over again. We use special board games to promote learning without realising it, child development, social face-to-face interaction, creative thinking and creating fun memories that anyone will enjoy.
We help children gain self-confidence, social skills, life skills and bond better with their families as they play our fun Maths games together.

BIRMINGHAM COLLEGE LIMITED,1-10 employees, "OUR STORY - THE BRITISH SOUND RETURNSBishopSound design and manufacture speakers for public performance. Reproducing the Great British sound.
During the 1960s a generation of British bands swept the world's music charts, taking with them not just their music, but also a very distinctive 'British sound' derived from the amplification and loudspeakers they used. It wasn't just in the world of guitar amplification that this distinctive tonal quality gained respect but also in Hi-Fi, recording studio mixing consoles, loudspeakers and PA systems.
One of the most important companies supplying this demand for 'British sound' equipment was Carlsbro Electronics, founded by the late Stuart Mercer in 1959. Hugely successful both at home and around the world, though Stuart passed away in 1996, the company's sound lived on and the company was eventually acquired by entrepreneur Andrew Bishop in 2001. Andrew drove the company to even greater international success before selling it to a leading Chinese manufacturer following the global financial crisis of 2008.
Demand for 'the British sound' did not diminish, however and with few manufacturers left who understood what it was or were able to offer it, customers turned to Andrew Bishop again, urging him to put his name to a new generation of PA equipment that while absolutely up to date was voiced with that distinctive and highly musical sound they felt was missing from a lot of PA equipment then on the market. BishopSound, launched in 2016, set out to do just that.
TODAY...BishopSound now supplies a large and rapidly growing demand in the UK for advanced PA equipment and related products which it also sells in over countries around the world - with more being added all the time. We proudly design our unique products here in Yorkshire, traditionally the home of some of the world's finest Hi-Fi equip

COGNITIVE FRAMEWORK UK LIMITED,11-50 employees, "Collision Management Systems, or CMS, is a world leader in the aggregation of connected data for improving risk management.
Our vision is a safer world through the better use of data. We are founded on three guiding principles: make the use of data simple, with that empower action, and do it all by delivering trust. 
We provide better risk management insight for insurers and fleet operators using telematics, employee, and any other related sensor data, plus any other relevant data the organisation has. Such as training plans, driver reviews, and traffic offences.
We aggregate this data, standardise it, make it consistent and comparable, then display it all in one system. This gives a full 360-degree picture of the risk situation at driver, depot, division, and organisation levels.
With this we have delivered strong ROI, in the first year, to our customers, through lower claims costs, faster responses and improved management efficiencies. 
Our SaaS platform, CMS Clara, provides clear actionable information, enabling our customers to answer the four principal risk management questions:
Is my organisation’s risk profile going up or down?
What behaviours are causing this change?
Which employees or drivers are the biggest contributors to my risk profile?
What incidents are occurring right now that I need to respond to?
This enables them to manage risk better by utilising their existing data to automatically identify and intervene with high risk drivers to reduce incidents. Plus, they are able to respond to accidents and incidents faster through real-time, accurate collision alerts, and the elimination of the need to sift through large volumes of false positives (a common issue with telematics systems).
All of this gives our customers the power to transform their duty of care, claims, and risk management programs, for drivers & remote workers. 
Thereby making for a safer world.

COMMONWEALTH FARMERS LIMITED,51-200 employees, "Blademaster Ground Engaging Tools provide increased durability and resilience in extreme operating environments such as mining and quarrying.Con Mech Engineers uses its in-house heat treatment facilities and metallurgy expertise means we can precisely control all the variables in the heating, quenching and tempering processes resulting in a steel micro structure with the required properties.  This means we can reliably achieve the abrasion and impact resistance required for optimum performance for different site conditions.  Tool thicknesses can be tailored to provide the wear material required and enable component life to coincide with maintenance schedules.Another key aspect of our process is to drill and cut the material before heat treatment to achieve a fully through hardened micro structure throughout the thickness of the product.  This provides a distinct advantage over pre-hardened wear plate which is subsequently processed.  Research has shown that induced heat from gas cutting the wear plate reduces hardness close to the cutting edge.  This creates 'soft spots' and can reduce the service life of the component.The range includes Xtreme Heavy-Duty and Very Heavy-Duty product lines for high abrasion  applications and the Xtreme-Tough product line, which provides greater strength and crack resistance in high impact situations.  Also Xtreme Sub-Zero range is designed with withstand cracking and breakage at very low temperatures down to -50 degrees C.

Wanting to help him feel included again, Becky decided to take matters into her own hands and create a range to help anyone feel included.
Made with 100% natural ingredients, you can enjoy our fantastic full-flavoured beers to your heart’s content, without compromising the good times. Just goes to show that life - and beer - tastes better when you do things your way.
OUR JOURNEY.
Nestled in the bustling heart of East London, Nirvana Brewery is on a mission to bring great alcohol-free options to true beer lovers.
The brewery was launched in 2017 by a family of beer enthusiasts with a simple mission; to dedicate itself entirely to the creation of quality alcohol-free craft beers. Coming from a family of beer lovers, when founder Becky’s dad Jim went teetotal, she wanted ensure that he would carry on feeling included socially and see his face light up again when handed a bottle. Since then Nirvana has opened up a whole new world of great tasting alcohol free beer for a growing movement of folks that like to have a good time but keep their senses intact. 
From familiar styles of beer such as stout, IPA and pale ales, to experimental brews including the world’s first kombucha beer, our tried and tested recipes produce quality alcohol-free alternatives, ready to be appreciated by craft beer enthusiasts and casual beer drinkers alike.
Made the proper way, just like any other craft beer, and with 100% natural ingredients, our fantastic full-flavoured beers come with their own distinctive personalities and benefits.

CUSKI BABY LIMITED,1-10 employees, "In 2016 NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) designated Cyberspace as the 5th warfare dimension after land, sea, air and space.  Cyberspace in recent years has become a unique theatre of operations where new and emerging adversaries can have as much impact as a larger, nation-state sponsored threat actor, where cross-discipline, multi-lateral technical supremacy is seen as the key indicator of an adversaries threat quotient regardless of size.The internet has opened up the opportunity for anyone with a basic, requisite set of technical expertise to learn and develop technical competency in mounting generally unsophisticated attacks, all the way through to developing low level exploits targeting critical network infrastructure.  What becomes apparent is that where it may haven taken years to develop a new kinetic weapons system for conventional warfare, the same constraints do not apply to the development of offensive malicious toolsets.  The velocity of adversarial technical progression is on an exponential trajectory.  The ease of access to knowledge, tools and the prevalence of stealth capabilities means that the possibility of an active threat faced by businesses of all sizes, industries and territories is not a matter of if, but when.The threat landscape is developing at an ever-accelerating pace.  Cyber-attacks are often reported against large multi-national organisations that often have the expertise and resources required to effectively defend and ultimately recover against such attacks, but the same cannot be said for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) which are often seen as soft targets for which the outcome can be terminal.

DEARCURVES,11-50 employees, "Delamere Dairy was founded in 1985 in Cheshire’s beautiful Delamere Forest, when Liz & Roger Sutton bought their first three goats. They began selling the fresh goats’ milk and soft cheese they made in their kitchen to local health food stores. Such was the interest in their products, that a couple of years later they were supplying milk to major UK retailers. By 1992 Delamere Dairy had outgrown its home in Delamere and moved to Yew Tree Farm in Knutsford. New products were added to the portfolio including semi-skimmed milk, with goats’ butter being made from the cream skimmed from the milk. As demand and interest in the health benefits of goats’ milk increased, plain and flavoured yogurts were added to the range.Today, Delamere Dairy sells an award-winning range of fresh and long life goats’ and cows’ milk-based speciality dairy products (cheese, yogurt, butter and milk) throughout the UK, Europe and around the world. Celebrating more than 30 years in business, the company has an annual turnover in excess of £28M.Delamere Dairy works closely with goat farmers across the UK and in 1999 it developed the Delamere Dairy Farm Assurance and Welfare Scheme to ensure consistent standards in farming and production. In 2001, the business was named Farm Business of the Year at the Farm Business Food & Farming Industry Awards and has gone on to win many more food, farming and industry awards.  Delamere Dairy is also listed in the Sunday Times SME Export Track 100, as the UK’s fastest growing food & drink exporter. In 2016, the company was awarded the UK’s most prestigious business award – The Queen’s Award for Enterprise, for its International Trade achievements.Following the theme of providing alternatives to traditional dairy, Delamere Dairy is launching its new plant based range of drinks in 2018. ‘Planted’ will consist of plant based drinks in both take home and ‘ready to drink’ formats, and will be available to customers across the UK and around the globe.

DETECTRONIC LIMITED,1-10 employees, "Diamond Hard Surfaces Ltd is a materials technology company and solution provider to high endurance applications of a unique amorphous diamond material; Adm™ which gives extended life in high temperature, chemically aggressive and abrasive environments. 
Using our patented process we are able to coat substrates from steel to thermoplastics giving components reduced friction, wear resistance and load carrying characteristics over and above traditional materials and other coated surfaces. The low temperatures at which the coating can be applied mean that there is minimal effect on the substrate material and the process is applicable to a wider range of materials.
Unlike other coatings, Adm Diamond Hard Surfaces do not require sophisticated and lengthy sub-layer preparation nor any post processing such as polishing. Components with our coatings are currently under test with many blue chip companies in the markets in which we operate. Our technology has been protected by patent and the manufacturing process has been developed in the company’s laboratory facilities.

DIRECT TRADE LIMITED,1-10 employees, "Following our successful launch in the Summer of 2019 we are now looking to expand our operation into the overseas market.
Our gin is special because we use 100%  UK grain spirit. The purity of which means we only use botanicals to enhance the flavour, not mask anything unpleasant.  Our recipe is very much a London Dry recipe, so no fashionable flavours, we infuse ‘Coriander, Juniper, Cassia Bark, Orange Lemon and, Almond’ and let it steep for 6 days and nights,  before it is blended down  to 40% ABV  with the help of some pure Sussex spring water. We  have a secret alchemist working with us who has been very busy.  This meant at the end of last year we were able to launch our latest product a Premium Toffee Vodka called Fling. Using the same high-quality UK grain spirit, this time lightly infused with rum essence, molasses, a dash of vanilla and of course toffee.  
We have certainly been noticed in the market place since launch. In October both Ditchling Gin & Ditchling Fling  won silver medals at the  Drink Business ‘Global Premium Spirits masters’ awards, which was a real honour for us to sit alongside established names in the business. 
Ditchling Gins label then won both a Gold and a Highly Commended in the ‘Harpers Design Award’, sitting alongside global brands with mega budgets.

DOLPHINSTAR LIMITED,1-10 employees, "Founded in 2014 by London College of Fashion graduate Youmeng Liu, Dream's Code is an emerging accessory brand based in London, whose artistic philosophy mixes modernity, elegance and tradition.
Growing up in the Southern province of Yunnan in China, Youmeng has always been fascinated by the embroidery of the ethnic Bai minority, which has a history going back to the Tang Dynasty. After successfully exhibiting artwork for the International Talent Support in Italy, she decided to marry her culture to beautiful British vegetable-tanned leather, using innovative and traditionally inspired designs. 
Youmeng designs accessories which are both modern, sophisticated and environmentally sustainable. Her desire is to create high quality products that have style and personality, but are also ecologically sound, and made using the ancient sewing techniques of the Bai. This personal approach became the brand's signature that can be found in each product. 
By using vegetable tanned leather, Dream's Code is advocating a higher standard quality and a long-lived product over large-scale production and mass consumption. Vegetable tanning process causes less pollution and is better for the environment, while the leather itself will mature over time, giving a unique character to your bag as it acquires a unique patina through use, and wear marks reflecting your own adventures. 
By using embroidery from the Yunnan and Dali region, Dream's Code develops the art of the Bai minority and introduces it to the world. The embroideries are all handmade, and tell the myths and spiritual stories of the region. 
Dream's Code, using extraordinary skills and modern shapes, aim to create better products using ancient art techniques, that reconnect our society to the environment that surrounds us.

ENERGYPEOPLE LIMITED,11-50 employees, "Since 1989 we have pioneered the use of electronics to solve fouling and scaling issues caused mainly by hard water.  We have done so by learning how to apply it effectively and most importantly how to measure its performance.This can be applied non-invasively to any diameter pipe and all pipe materials. Even on the largest pipe treated (one metre), the power consumption of the unit was just 20 watts/hour.Because of the ability to remove existing scaling in water systems it offers a very attractive method of assisting in meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets in existing buildings.When EWC is applied to a swimming pool it can significantly reduce chlorine consumption, improve turbidity and filtration and save water due to reduced requirement to backwash filters.  Treated water also removes staining on pool surfaces and reduces the energy used to heat the pool.We are currently developing a similar non-chemical technology to address corrosion and biofilm in primary heating systems and Anaerobic Digestion (AD) plant.  The technologies reduce fouling and corrosion to allow better heat transfer resulting in, better control of heating and cooling equipment temperatures and in the case of AD will allow the optimisation of methane gas production with consequent increased levels of green energy generation.We are keen to expand into other countries by finding like-minded partners and help them successfully apply the technology, by teaching them how it can be best be achieved. To assist this we have hundreds of News stories outlining successful installations and many test reports confirming efficacy.British Water’s International Director, Lila Thompson has stated “The circular economy is an alternative to the traditional linear economy of make, use and dispose. It keeps resources in use for as long as possible, saving money and reducing waste”.   This is one of the many tangible benefits of our technology, ENiGMA.

Since then we have dominated the USA and Canadian markets.In 2006, Chris’s Daughter, Gina Fasey, joined the Company as CEO of the Fingersafe® group of companies.Fingersafe® has evolved for over 20 years and has had an enormous impact on the once overlooked issue of door safety. Door related finger injuries are an unfortunate fact of life. These horrendous accidents, especially amongst children are an all too common occurrence and can leave terrible scars both physically and mentally. Thousands of accidents have been prevented due to the installation of Fingersafe®.We are extremely proud of Fingersafe® and the reputation it has gained throughout the world.Fingersafe® is the original finger hinge protector for doors. No other hinge protection actually ejects fingers from the opening hinge side of a door. Other companies, through the inadequacies of their products, have actually enhanced the Fingersafe® brand in the market place.A simple, yet ingenious design, enables Fingersafes® various products to be fitted neatly and unobtrusively to almost any door.

FIDABONA LIMITED,Household goods, furniture and furnishings, "Fired Earth began back in 1983 selling Terracotta floor tiles, a product that customers were soon keen to use in their homes in order to bring a little Spanish style to kitchens, hallways and conservatories. Demand for other stylish tiles grew and so wall tiles were added alongside stones and slates. By the mid 1990's the business had grown from its farm beginnings in Oxfordshire to 15 showrooms across the country. Our first large London showroom, at 117-119 Fulham Road, opened in 1996 and is still proudly trading today, albeit joined by 13 other London showrooms since. Along the way we added Paint and Bathrooms to our collections. Today, we believe we have earned the title of 'the home of great design'.
Our aim has always been to offer products produced with authenticity, creativity and style, and where possible both handmade and produced as close to home as we can manage. The UK Ceramics Industry has a long tradition and it is one we are keen to support. Having said that, where we spot a tile on our travels that is too beautiful to resist, we do of course secure it exclusively for our customers, many of whom are second generation fans of Fired Earth and its products.
Decorating and design have become entrenched in the national mind not just as the preserve of the super wealthy, but as a way to create homes for ourselves and our families that reflect how we like to live today. At Fired Earth we like to think that although it may not be every day our customers choose to redecorate (although our paint does allow for just that level of obsession), we have identified the right looks and styles that feel perfect no matter what the style or age of property. Our website has grown too and now offers almost all of our collections to browse and buy online and shows stunning room sets and great design ideas to help inspire you.
We look forward to welcoming you.

Even better, the microclimate in your polytunnel means even bigger, healthier crops...and a much, much longer growing season. And the more you grow...the more you save!
Miles of smilesWith fuel prices at an all-time high, cutting out trips to buy your fruit and veg will mean less miles racked up visiting the forecourt too. That's money in the bank...straight away. And while you're saving £££'s, you're helping save the environment too. Bit of a win win!
Exercise everything...except your walletThrowing your heart and soul into things inside the polytunnel is a good workout and a lot less tedious - and costly - than paying to go to the gym! And for anyone who has problems bending down, raised beds bring the gardening up to you, so tending crops and weed management is much, much easier.
Something you can't put a price on..Your inner health! You control what - and how - you grow. So the pesticides, herbicides and other nasties that might have been used on commercially grown crops are kept out of your polytunnel...and out of your body. And don't underestimate the value to your wellbeing that comes from the simple joy of seeing your hard work bearing fruit.

FUTURELEARN LIMITED,1-10 employees, "Fusion sells quality instrument bags and accessories to professional and travelling musicians around the world from our base in West Yorkshire, England.
The idea of developing high quality, innovative gig bags for travelling musicians, was created by four friends around a dining room table in March 2008.The vision soon became reality. After carefully sourcing a factory and months of hard work designing and sampling our first range of bags, we launched Fusion at the Music China Show in Shanghai 2008.
The show was a huge success and was followed by the popular NAMM Show in California and Musikmesse in Germany. These shows helped us create a network of international distributors who started selling our designer gig bags for guitars, brass, woodwind and keyboards around the world.
More than just a gig bag!Right from the very start we had a vision to create the best gig bags on the market. These were designed with the musician in mind and to exceed expectations.
We found that the best way to design an amazing product is to speak to the people who we wanted to create bags for. What are their needs, wants and challenges?
Co-founder and designer Amanda Wheatley’s own experience as a gigging trumpet player, along with her creativity and drive for innovation and perfection, helped bring her designs to life. Our collaboration with so many other musicians’ experiences of touring the world or simply commuting to work with their instrument helped us create our incredible collection of cases. This included bagpipes to saxophones, guitar and cymbal bags and the much loved ukulele gig bags.
To create gig bags that are lightweight and comfortable enough for travelling the world, whilst still offering the best level of protection and space for any serious pro, is what we strive to achieve and of course they also need to look good.

GAUGE DEVELOPMENTS GROUP LIMITED,1-10 employees, "GeeJay Chemicals Limited are a family company that have been established in Sandy, England for over 35 years, progressing to a purpose built building, opened in 2007.
Desiccant silica gel sachets were first made in 1984. Today, four modern machines make sachets of weights ½ gram, 1 g, 3 g, 5 g, 10 g, 25 g, 50 g, 100 g, 250 g, 500 g and 1 kg. Larger bags (2½ kg to 10 kg) are made using industrial sewing machines.
Silica gel sachets account for most of our output – both non-indicating (white) and self-indicating (orange to green and blue to pink) types. Molecular sieve sachets (grades 3A, 4A and 13X) and desiccant clay sachets (½ unit to 32 unit) are also regularly made.
All of these desiccants, plus activated alumina, are also sold in bulk in a variety of containers from 40 gram aluminium foils to 150 kg steel drums. Humidity indicator cards complete the product range.
Being a small company, we are very flexible and while the standard range of sachets is kept in stock for prompt delivery, many other items are also made. Sachets can be made of non-standard weights and shapes, with special printing or custom packed in individual polybags or foils. Sachets in cotton, sachets in bandoliers and sachets with hanging tapes attached are all available.
From the outset ‘service’ and ‘quality’ were, and still are, the priorities of the business.Service, as illustrated above, through supply to customer’s requirements and the ability toprovide flexible quantities, non-standard pack sizes and urgent deliveries. In 1991, with onlythree employees, we developed a quality system that was audited, approved and registeredby the British Standards Institute to BS5750. This has developed through to the current Quality Management System ISO 9001:2015.
Over the years, export sales have grown to include over 50 different countries and 20% of our turnover in 2018.

GENILUX LTD,Food and drink, "Davina launched Get Fruity bar in 2013, but it had been a dream of hers since 2000 when she worked in New Product Development for large corporate companies. Davina also graduated from Bournemouth University with a Bachelor of Science BSc (Hons) in Food Science. Since then the demand for our award winning bars has grown tremendously. This is due to the great taste of our bars and that our only allergen is gluten free oats. Our passionate team continues to produce high quality healthy fruit and oat bars.
The Get Fruity Bar dream only became a reality when Davina moved back to her home county of Cornwall. With two young toddlers at her feet she started to develop snack bars that filled the gap of a premium, healthy, baked artisan bar that all the family could enjoy. The cost of ingredients went out the window as it was all about taste, quality and texture. It was hard to get ingredients at first as she contacted the large corporations she had worked with previously. After months of trialling snack bar recipes she was then ready to test them out. The chief testers were, of course, her children who were very fussy eaters. Once she got the thumbs up from her family and friends it was time to move on and work on how to produce her homemade fruit and oat bars. Davina set up a production line in a small unit where everything was handmade. The three flavours launched where Juicy Apricot, Orange and Ginger, Scrumptious Strawberries, and Moist Mixed Berry. Get Fruity Bars first customer was The Eden Project and they continue to buy our bars today for their popular children’s lunch box. Get Fruity proved popular not just for its amazing taste but also because it was Vegan along with gluten and dairy-free.

GOLDCLASS INVESTMENT BROKERS LIMITED,1-10 employees, "Introducing Granite North Gin
Local lore has it that Highlanders took to the hills with mobile stills to make more than just illicit whisky. Nearly 300 years ago, the rugged, mountainous landscape was rich in the botanicals that can be found in many a modern Scottish gin. Using juniper, pine needles, heather and thistles that were all available in abundance, those early distilling pioneers made a spirit that was a forerunner to modern gin with a truly distinctive Scottish twist. 
Today, the highland landscape is still as wild and rugged and rich in ingredients as it was back then. And it's this dramatic landscape, and the pioneering spirit of its former residents, that is the inspiration for Granite North Gin. The gin recipe was developed in Aberdeen with the magnificent Cairngorm Mountain range visible in the distance and is distilled in the same hills that once held the Highlanders secrets. 
Taking its name from the rock so closely associated with the North East of Scotland, Granite North Gin is inspired by the rugged peaks and ancient forests of the Scottish Highlands.
Developed for the modern adventurer, Granite North is a smooth London Dry gin packed with flavour. A juniper-forward gin, its fresh, citrus taste is smooth enough to drink on its own or with a light tonic to release even more of its zesty flavour and is robust enough to stand up and stand out in cocktails. Its outdoor personality is revealed in the subtle infusion of Grand Fir needles that complement the native taste of its juniper cousin, helping to summon the fresh aromas of the pure mountain air.
Handcrafted in small batches in the Highlands of Scotland, Granite North Gin is distilled using water from its Cairngorm Mountain range home. With its rich contour of flavours capturing the essence of the rugged Highland landscape, Granite North Gin will warm on the coldest winter nights and refresh on the balmiest of summer days.

GREENGATE BUSINESS ASSOCIATES LIMITED,1-10 employees, "Our ingredients are simple and pure: Barley, hops, yeast and water, sometimes a little wheat or corn to vary the style. We source all ingredients, where possible locally. Organic barley comes from the local estate and we regularly meet the farm managers to ensure the planting will yield correct protein content. The barley is roasted to our own, very precise specifications.
Malting & Mashing: Malting is the process where barley grain is made ready for brewing. Malting is broken down into three steps in order to help to release the starches in the barley. Mashing converts the starches released during the malting stage into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a mash tun.
Lautering, Boiling & Whirlpool: Lautering is the separation of the wort (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. After mashing, the beer wort is boiled with hops in a large tank known as brew kettle. At the end of the boil, solid particles in the hopped wort are separated out, usually in a vessel called a ''whirlpool'' or ''settling tank''.
Fermenting: Fermentation takes place in fermentation vessels which come in various forms, from enormous cylindroconical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats.Conditioning: After an initial or primary fermentation, beer is conditioned, matured or aged, which can take from 2 to 4 weeks.
Filtering & Packaging: We use triple filter process offering crisp & clean taste. After filtering & packaging the beer leaves the brewery and is stocked on several restaurants and retail stores all over the UK & Europe.

Hi, we’re Dean and Joanne, the husband and wife team of Naturelly and along with Liam (Dean’s brother) and our daughters, we are the Naturelly Family.Here you can find out all about why we do what we do, what makes us bounce out of bed in the morning and what inspires us to make our fun and healthy, Naturelly Jelly Juice.Our girls  just love to dance and play and climb and jump! What better way to encourage their playfulness than through the jiggly jelly fun of Naturelly Jelly Juice.What inspired us to make this wonderful fun and fruity treat?Trying to find healthy snacks was always challenging for us; especially when on days out or picking the girls up from school and nursery. Tears and tantrums would often follow. We needed an on the go refreshment that would fill them up just a little, until dinner time. So, we put all of our crazy brains together to find out the stuff our kids and their friends loved and this led us to the idea of creating Naturelly Jelly Juice.Jelly + Juice, simple! But, how could we make it healthy and not full of sugar?Well, first of all we discovered this special gelatine free, wibbly jelly made from Lily Plants called Gellan Gum.  This clever jelly helps fill little tummies up until meal time with it being a natural dietary fibre and by mixing it with fruit juice it helps stop those cravings for sugary snacks. We also made sure we didn’t add any sugar OR sweeteners, OR artificial colours, OR artificial flavours OR artificial preservatives! Being parents ourselves, we only wanted natural ingredients for our little ones. Our juice is Not from Concentrate and Naturelly is sweet by nature with nothing added.

Howard Kennedy LLP,1-10 employees, "SOCATOTS, formed in 2003 is a football based developmental activity programme specifically designed for children (girls and boys) aged 6 months - 5 years old.  It offers a unique approach designed around systematic training sessions involving parents'​ active participation.  Children attend regular sessions with other children of a similar age, where they master both motor and social skills under the watchful eye of highly qualified coaches. SOCATOTS'​ mission is to engage more and more children in physical activity, using football as a medium. We teach basic movement patterns, balance and motor coordination. Most important, we ensure that physical activity is fun.
Brazilian Soccer Schools is the unique Soccer coaching programme for children aged 5 and above incorporating Futebol de Salão. 
The central aim of Brazilian Soccer Schools is to encourage children to spend longer working with the ball practicing and developing their skills. Everything that we do has this in mind and at BSS training sessions almost all of the time will be spent working with the ball at your feet.
Futebol de Salão is a 5-a-side version of football of South American origin that is played with a smaller (size 2), heavier (465g) ball that has virtually no bounce (10%). The game became very popular in Brazil where players such as Pele, Rivelino, Zico right through to Juninho, Ronaldo and Rivaldo were brought up first playing Futebol de Salão before moving on to conventional football. Following FIFA's decision to promote the game of Futsal (5-a-side played with a size 4 ball with 20-25% rebound) Futebol de Salão has virtually died out in South America and is now developed globally through Brazilian Soccer Schools and SOCATOTS who see the game as being the best development tool for children in football.

I.T. TRANSPORT LIMITED,Business and consumer services, "Since 2014, Idea Drop has offered a software-as-a-service (SAAS) that helps businesses identify, refine and execute their most innovative ideas. Our company was founded on the premise that the best ideas already exist, they just need to be discovered.
We believe that companies relying on outdated methods for new ideas aren’t making the most of their employees’ potential. Some of the best ideas can be found in the most unlikely places. Therefore, we wanted to help businesses create an 'innovation culture' across their workforce. 
Our platform is entirely cloud-based, with a ‘social media’ style interface that makes it easy and cost-effective for teams to collaborate on new ideas. When developing Idea Drop, one problem we encountered was that businesses struggled to push ideas through an ‘innovation pipeline’. This indicated that there were no processes in place to ensure the best new ideas were actually executed. Our platform has an array of features, from scoring metrics and reports to Twitter-style hashtags, bulletins and status updates. All of these features are designed to help nurture the best ideas to completion, with the resultant impact on the business then evaluated to determine the idea’s success. 
Companies across multiple global industries have seen success with Idea Drop. Examples range from multinational enterprises such as Ericsson and MTV to public sector organisations such as the NHS and Kent Police Force. We have an established track record of delivering long-term value for our clients. For instance, Covea Insurance found that an idea implemented as a result of Idea Drop would save them £2.5m over the next 5 years. Idea Drop is committed to ensuring clients get the most out of innovation management. Our team of experts are on-hand to help companies implement our software, helping to obtain stakeholder buy-in whilst providing technical guidance and support.

In addition, all trainers have relevant teaching qualifications in order to impart their knowledge to others in a relaxed yet professional manner.
In addition to the grief and suffering they cause, road traffic collisions constitute an important public health and development problem with significant health and socioeconomic costs. Considerable economic losses are not only incurred by victims and their families, but also by nations as a whole: road crashes cost most countries 1–3% of their gross national product.
The unfortunate reality is that even with the great work being carried out by numerous organisations globally to reduce road deaths and injuries is that there will be times when these terrible accidents still occur and we at IRRTC believe that we can make an impact in supporting rescue responder’s worldwide in reducing the impact of these incidents by providing expert training in both their medical and technical response capabilities.
Whilst data is limited, the proportion of patients who die before reaching hospital in low- and middle-income countries is estimated as at least twice that in high-income countries, suggesting that strengthening pre-hospital systems could have enormous global impact in reducing fatalities.

If you have a commercial premise we can supply wholesale Islamic Art with Truvue anti-reflection glass (also blocks 99%) of UV rays and package it securely and export it to anywhere in the world.
The glass is important as we are currently exporting to some large hotel and commercial projects being built in the UAE where UV rays can be quite high, if you do not use the right glass the print can become faded after some time as well as using the right frame to ensure no damp comes inside due to Humid climate.
You can see our work at the Dubai Art Fair, Mohammed Khan our chief calligrapher and designer creates one of pieces that are showcased and then we create lithograph prints that are used in our framed Islamic artwork pieces. Each lithograph print is certified and hand signed so you know it is part of an original collection.Our team can export containers of Framed Islamic Art securely so it arrives with you zero damage.

UNIQUE DESIGN
What makes our range of Compact Front Boxes different from most is that they are designed to attach to the front of tractors when the arms are folded up to reduce front overhang.
The low-profile design provides for a good line of sight and excellent stability. The boxes also minimise the danger of carrying tools and equipment in the cab.
BUILT TO SUIT
As not all front linkages fold up in the same way, we have developed a range of brackets that are specific to different manufacturers. Boxes are available for any front linkage and can be painted to match manufacturers or your choice.
Over the years, JF Hudson has created a number of unique agricultural products which support farmers’ work while allowing for greater efficiency and cost reduction. Founded on experience in the industry, a full working knowledge of agriculture and specialist engineering skills, our product range is designed to solve problems.
The box improves visibility when pulling out of field gateways onto roads etc., and is designed to be mounted on front 3-point linkage of a tractor whilst the linkage is folded up to minimise the distance the attachment sticks out in front. 
The boxes are also sealed to ensure the contents stay dry and safely locked away. removes the need to store tools and other items in the cab, removing the danger of flying objects if a tractor rolls over.

Operating in conjunction with automatic cluster removal (ACR) and gently supporting the cluster, it eliminates any bias between front and rear quarters, something that may go undetected, but which can be the underlying cause of many of the increased mastitis incidences in front quarters. The durable, high-density polyurethane (HDPE) supports also help avoid liner slip and kick-offs, and the consequential time and labour involved in re-attachment.
Lactalign can be fitted to most types of parlours whether rotary, rapid exit or herringbone.
The development has been studied independently by The Dairy Group director and milking technology national specialist Ian Ohnstad who says the widely accepted real cost of a case of mastitis is about £225 (GBP) and that does not take into account the current uplift in milk values.
At Metcalfe Farms (UK), the Lactalign supports have shown a 59% reduction in liner slip, a 47% reduction in kick-offs, a 65% reduction in re-attachments and a 50% reduction in mastitis cases in front quarters.
Mastitis aside, the Lactalign device is popular among the milking team for convenience such as the time saved on reattachments and reducing disruptions such as dealing with liner slip, which is also very uncomfortable for cows during milking.
Lactalign has a worldwide patent pending, and is proud to be manufactured in the UK.

We have always worked to ISO 9001 and ISO 22000:2005 as our first blender came with a full, modern, Quality management system and we put it is one of the best blending plants in the UK where we learned to craft of Powder Blending off one the best, most experienced and knowledgeable blenders in Europe at that time.  This allowed us to lead from the start.
We started by innovating products.  Our first formulation was a Joint Formula but our second was a Whey Protein Blend - when whey protein blends were unheard of.  We had to source the ingredients, create the product, engineer it to mix in water without foaming and make it taste better than everything else available at that time.  We did not copy anyone.  We started with a blank sheet of paper. 
We started with one small blender, but soon introduced a second, 750kg, blender.  This opened doors to cost effectiveness but also made more consistent blends. It also put us in a position where we could get ahead of our Brands' requirements allowing us to deliver exceptional service - making to stock and delivering in days.
This is how we have progressed and how we work for our brands.  We built the product and future innovations into on the the UK's and Europe's leading Sports Nutrition brands.  So this is how we produce products today.  We prefer to innovate new products.  We do not copy others.

M&J FOOD BROKERS LTD,Metallurgical process plant, "Core Products:1. Imhoflot Reactor Flotation2. Aachen gold / silver leaching3. LeachOx refractory gold leaching4. CN-D cyanide destruction5. RoStar energy-efficient ultra fine grinding
Imhoflot pneumatic flotation technology has evolved through 25 years of industrial applications. This has led to the development of the patented Imhoflot G-Cell where centrifugal forces are used in the cell to quickly separate the phases after mineral collection and therefore considerably reducing the size of vessels required.
Imhoflot is characterised by:
High selectivity in terms of grade versus recovery relationship due to very small bubble sizes initially generated in the reactor and very high energy utilization in mineral collectionEfficient in also recovering small (<20µm) and coarse (>350µm) particles where tank flotation is inefficientSmall cell volumes and therefore small flotation plant footprintNo moving partsLower energy requirement as there is no rotor/stator required to keep the pulp in suspension
Aachen Reactors™Several mineral and metallurgical processes require gas-liquid or gas-slurry mass transfer for chemical reactions to occur.
For example:
Gold leaching using aerated cyanide solutionsOxidation of sulphide mineralsFerric generationChemical decontamination and soil remediationAlkaline sulphidisationWaste water and effluent oxidation
The Leachox process flowsheet can be designed to treat refractory or double refractory ores that contain “preg robbers”. It can also be used to treat standard, non refractory, flotation and gravity concentrates in a more cost effective manner than alternative methods. 
The objective of developing the Ro-Star is to offer the most cost effective and efficient ultra-fine grinding mill available on the market today. The target is to grind all types of minerals to the required liberation sizes below approximately 53 microns and, if required, even to the very fine sizes of below 10 microns.

M.P. BIO SCIENCE LIMITED,Agriculture, horticulture and fisheries, "In 2001 West Country Nurseries in Cornwall were looking for a semi automatic seeder for their nursery.  Unfortunately they couldn't find anything suitable and so they designed the Magic Seeder.  After extensive trials The Magic Seeder Company Limited was formed to make the seeders available throughout Europe.
In 2004 The Magic Seeder won the award for the best new retail product at the South West Regional Growers Show in Exeter.
The following year the seeder was re-designed in order to help those with problems with their grip.
There are now two versions of the Magic Seeder.  The original  Connecticut seeder has a round body with a screw on cap.  
The Cornwall seeder has a square body making it easier to grip. It also has a clip on top. 
Both versions are easy to use.
Since that point The Magic Seeder has gone on to become Europe's best selling hand held seeder.  
The company is always looking at new ideas and has designed and manufactured a number of additional products.  
Currently the seeders are sold in France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Portugal and New Zealand.

MACKAY'S LTD.,Ports and logistics, "Magway is a sustainable zero-emissions solution for transporting goods through pipelines. It addresses the increased volume of parcel deliveries, from the rapid growth in e-commerce amplified in a post-covid world and the resulting impact of heavy and light goods vehicles on the environment and an inadequate road infrastructure. Combining a novel application of tried and tested technology and our own patented intellectual property, (Magway is at the forefront of linear motor design) Magway has the potential to address these challenges and revolutionise e-commerce logistics. Other applications include movement of goods into and around airports and large manufacturing sites. Our solution utilises small-diameter (0.9m) tubes similar to those currently used by major utility companies with linear motors transporting the goods internally. This diameter pipe can accommodate all of the on-line grocery delivery market and over 90% of e-commerce parcel deliveries. As such Magway is low impact, has relatively low capital investment and substantially lower operating costs than the current modes of transport being used. A tested solution that is secure, not vulnerable to payload theft, is not limited by weather, driver error or shortage, and will deliver considerable savings to retailers and subsequently their customers; Magway delivers benefits to air quality, congestion, road maintenance costs, and residential and commercial development. Because the system is lightweight and electrically powered, it is energy efficient, produces zero emissions and can exploit renewable energy resources, thus reducing carbon emissions. These high-capacity and small-footprint links will reduce congestion, taking vehicles off the roads, and provide the additional capacity to accommodate the expected growth in online retailing and e-commerce, as well as in freight/logistics more generally. Magway presents an end-to-end clean delivery solution and is a “game-changer” for e-commerce logistics.

MONVATOO LTD,1-10 employees, "Middle age men, dress safely and conservatively.  They don’t experiment with colour and detail. I felt that there was a huge market out there for men from 30+ to still dress fashionably and smart, without having to break the bank at the high end designer led market, or to be forced to shop at safe high street stores that also offer you, your weekly grocery shop.
My first collection was brought about by my desire to dress myself, and my compatriots. Everything from our collection can fit very comfortably into my wardrobe or any other mans wardrobe. There are pieces to wear at the weekend with jeans or chinos, and pieces that would look just as good in the office over a crisp white shirt, or under a blazer on a night out.
I wanted items that fitted well, wore well, are investment pieces, and had just that little bit of detail in them, so they stood out from the rest of the high street, and brought compliments and admiring looks.
I like looks that are edgy and classic, and felt that there is a huge audience out there that want the same, but don’t have the product to available to them. Most men feel comfortable in blacks and greys, but give them the choice of wearing some colour, that isn’t too loud, and they will find a place or the occasion to wear the MrQ collection.

McBrides Chartered Accountants,1-10 employees, "Being a leader brings great responsibility. In our decades of work developing leaders, we see a common response to that responsibility: leaders strive to be good at everything. Research, and our experience, tells us that the ‘perfect’ leader does not exist. In fact, evidence shows great leaders:
- Have a strong understanding of their own unique strengths and capitalise on them
- Address their most important individual weaknesses
- Understand and tap into the strengths of others
Based on organisational psychology principles, the My Leadership Strengths model provides leaders with the flexibility to focus on what matters most to them, their team and their role – rather than a one size fits all view of leadership.
Our Leadership 360 and QPT assessment products aim to provide busy managers with opportunities to develop by identifying what they need to focus on and get started building the capabilities they need to succeed.

OCEAN PROCUREMENT SERVICES LIMITED,Clothing, footwear and fashion, "Olivia Annabelle is founded by Olivia Welsh, a Fashion Designer from Manchester. A frustration with the lack of diversity in design and innovation on the high street fostered a desire to design clothes made from beautiful fabrics that are unique, well made and don't follow trends. At the heart of the brand is our aim to make limited edition high-quality pieces that have longevity and timeless appeal that can be kept and worn forever.In a world of throwaway over-produced fast fashion we have made it our mission to improve the way we produce our collections and are always striving for even more sustainable production methods and materials. We are constantly working to achieve this by sourcing natural fabrics for our collections.Olivia Annabelle creates two-three small capsule collections per year. We have now sent orders off to over 26 different countries and are building up a base of international loyal customers.Olivia Annabelle has an inherently British feel, and takes inspiration from the nostalgia of the past, local traditions and superstitions, with hours spent researching the history, novels, art and culture of each theme. Each collection is themed and designed with exclusive playful one-off prints and accessories all designed in-house by our small but dedicated team of talented creatives. With an emphasis on whimsical, feminine and classic silhouettes taken from different time periods combined with distinctive prints and traditional fabrics, the result is a unique but carefully curated collection that encapsulates the romantic spirit of dressing up in a contemporary world.At Olivia Annabelle we believe that finding high-quality fabrics doesn’t have to mean ‘plain’ – we pride ourselves on the extensive research we do when sourcing fabrics to find unique and luxurious materials, which we compliment with our own distinctive and original prints.

We can help you get your plans ready and validate them though auditing and exercising. We can design call-out procedures and check that they are fit for purpose and ready to execute.
It is DURING an emergency that all your planning, training and exercising is put to the ultimate test. Responding to emergencies requires effective communications, command, control and coordination and the ability to work calmly with many other organisations. We can help organisations perform better during the response phase and show them how to share essential information, make decisions and record them accurately and clearly.
AFTER the emergency response and the search, rescue and identification of victims is over it is what happens next that is typically the most challenging to plan for, train for and test. Experience in many parts of the world demonstrate that it is the phase that is often poorly managed with little thought for the welfare and monitoring of emergency responders, and the affected community. We can assist shape what is often called the recovery phase.
In addition to helping organisations prepare for, respond to, and recover from emergencies and other crises, we are able to provide real-time support through professional help and on-the-ground advice, if required.

By using our software you increase efficiencies by automatically shutting down unused PCs and by switching PCs on for the start of the day so no work time is impacted on. You also save money throughout the day with effective use of hibernate.
Thousands of hours can be saved and huge energy savings can be made with an automated solution like TaskForceCO2.
We offer a range of attractive affordable licenses that generally allows for TaskForceCO2 to pay for itself in a matter of weeks and it is particularly useful in an educational environment where users do not take responsibility for shutting down PCs.

PLAN DIGITAL LIMITED,Household goods, furniture and furnishings, "Pott’s foundations are in two very simple ideas: love your planet and support local artisan makers. Oh, and always be kind!
In the UK every year 360 million candles are burned. The figure really stuck in our minds and all we could think was ‘what happens to all the empty candle pots?’. They’re either in the bin or, If you’re anything like us, you’ll have tucked them away in the back of a cupboard thinking one day you’ll find a use for them (still waiting for that day...).
Every time we finished a candle we had this sense of guilt and always wondered why they can’t be reused or refilled. We decided we were going to do something about it and create a candle where you only need one Pott for the rest of your life.
We believe that small changes make a big impact. We want to make it easy for you to enjoy candles in a more sustainable way, whilst also supporting local and independent UK-based artisans. The Potts are hand-thrown by potters across the UK. If you’re only going to have one candle Pott you may as well make it a nice one! And what is nicer than a product that has been lovingly handcrafted by a skilled artisan. Because the Potts are handmade, they are all slightly different and have their own little personalities...it is your own unique Pott, handcrafted by us, just for you. 
All our candles are lovingly blended and hand-poured, using natural wax with 100% natural essential oils and sustainable fragrance oils. We regularly update our scents to match the seasons and make you happy! 
The seasons will change and the scents will change, but your Pott is with you for the long haul.

POINTR LIMITED,11-50 employees, "Premier Roof Systems was founded in 2011 by two local industry professionals Jamie Blackwood and Chris Mullen. Since the beginning we have built a team of hardworking and professional individuals to offer design, manufacture, supply and installation of high performance systems within the fenestration industry to improve people’s home living experience.
Following our consistent year on year growth; in 2016 we wanted to scale into a wider market and leverage our growth. The obvious choice for us was to invest on the marketing function which didn't exist until March 2016. We took on a marketing manager - Pouya Bostani - who supported the business to gear up for the bigger growth by not just implementing marketing strategies but to set a better infrastructure for the business. 
In summer 2016 we moved our manufacturing facility for the second time to allow for the expansion and started to ship our products UK nationwide.  However all these fast changes had a negative impact on the business's profitability; hence we have decided to refocus on the infrastructure and consolidate any unnecessary outlay.
Early 2017 we started to increase our market share by expanding our product portfolio and  through partnership by market leading manufacturers/suppliers.
Just after newly appointed MD - Pouya Bostani - in February 2018, Premier Roof Systems almost hit a £2m turnover following  a consistent month on month record breaking sales figures which was a milestone for the business. 
To date, we have built a great relationship with our trade customers and homeowners nationwide and our mission is to strive for the best customer experience and improve people's standard of living.

Pattern Hive,1-10 employees, "Remote Monitoring Asthma using IoT.
Asthma is a complex disease and there are multiple triggers both environmental and psychological, which can cause inflammation or allergic reaction within the airways resulting in an attack. These triggers are unique to each patient and exposure can change depending on the season, the patient’s location, weather & personal circumstances. Increasingly, the impact of air quality is being identified as affecting asthma.
Lack of information for patient self-management, imperfect adherence in taking medication, and reliance on fallible patient memory at doctors’ surgeries, results in sub-optimal asthma control. Overall, this leads to increase in oral corticosteroid use, acute exacerbations, hospital admissions and mortality.
Ultimately, lack of real and timely information results in greater costs to the health care system, patients who have acute exacerbations of asthma costing 3.5 times as much as those who don't.  
By remotely capturing the patients circumstancial and environmental data, the QIoT connected, smart IoT technology and patients App can help to:
•	Support Asthma teams around clinical utility.•	Add value when guiding Asthma management plans.•	Creating more personalised Asthma care plans.•	Identifying never before seen dangerous trends (allowing for early intervention).•	Improve attendance at Asthma clinic.•	Supports patient self-management.•	Reduced hospital admissions and costs.•	Deliver bespoke pollen forecasts helping reduce exasperations.•	Over time, allow Health professionals to remotely manage more patient, freeing up valuable clinical appointments?•	Increased days with no symptoms?•	Better accuracy in predicting peak flow results. •	Increases in FEP adherence and monitoring.
By also informing patients when medication is running low, and measuring stress and activity levels daily, it a true solution to help both patient and health care providers manage effectively.

On the 1st September 2018, RedKnight celebrates becoming 3 years old. We have been extremely fortunate to work with some incredible clients in that time, both in the UK and beyond.

REBEL DISTILLERS LTD,Environment, "MicronFog™ systems are designed to produce fog where you want it, when you want it and in the quantity that you need.  Our journey began marketing fogging systems for dust control and dust suppression.   Airborne respirable dust particles remain in the air for a long time.  Accumulation of these particles in the lungs leads to serious pulmonary illnesses that can take years to show up.  Fog solves this by causing the dust to stick to the water droplet, making it heavy enough to fall out of the air.  As long as the dust does not repel water, then fog will clarify the air for you.
That is one use.  Another is making use of flash evaporation to either cool the air or humidify it.  The cooling is useful where there are large crowds and queues in high temperatures.  Fog helps make this bearable.  Alternatively, humidification can increase the reliability of industrial processes by maintaining ideal levels for the process materials.  For growers, close control of humidity can result in improved crop yields.  By simulating the natural environment, optimal growing conditions can be created closer to the relevant market.
Fog can also be used to enhance visitor experience at tourist attractions by enhancing led lighting or just adding to the atmosphere at an event.  Our systems have been used for film special effects as well.
With in house design of the systems, we are always ready to discuss how they can be adapted to deliver your project, in the way you require it.  Do contact us to discuss your requirements  and see what we can do for you.

SANDSTONE INTERNATIONAL GROUP LTD,Healthcare and medical, "We understand that finding suitable care and accommodation for yourself or a loved one can often be difficult, confusing and sometimes upsetting. We realise that in this day and age, people's perception of care for the elderly is tainted by the image of an institutional, impersonal 'old peoples home' or 'nursing home'. As one approaches an older age, such fears can often inhibit the desire to find appropriate help which can be hugely detrimental to both their health and life.
We recognise that during old age, life can become increasingly difficult due to a gradual decline in health, mobility or with the onset of dementia. This can hamper the ability to find services, support or information around homes that can provide appropriate care for their age and can lead them to search for services such as nursing care which may actually be inappropriate for their needs, adding further confusion.
Scimitar Care is different. As providers of outstanding elderly residential care homes in Hertfordshire, Essex, Cambridge, Enfield and London, we opened our first residential care hotel for the elderly in 1973. Our goal then was to help afford a standard of accommodation and level of service to match the expectations of the most discerning resident. Over forty years later our reputation for care and quality is second to none.
Our elderly care homes can help you find the right services and support required to assist your daily living, whilst helping you find and build new relationships with people of a similar age. We work with our residents to ensure that our care homes focus specifically on their health needs and we tune our services to tailor a care package that provides an experience unique to each person.
As our residential care homes cater for and provide personalised care for the elderly, we are adept at supporting those both living with or without Dementia. We specialise in offering respite care services for older people which is available throughout the year.

SANTANE LTD,Metals, minerals and materials, "The Minex Process is a patented technology that economically extracts metals contained in commercial smelter and refinery slags. It employs patented fluidised bed technology and gaseous chloride extraction chemistry which is extremely efficient at removing all target metals in a single simple operation. Generally, more than 90% of the metals which remain in the slags are extracted and recovered.The benefits of the process over conventional fluidised bed technology are the significant reduction in melting point temperatures and the ability to target all metals in a single continual process.  Due to these significant melting point reductions, energy required for the Minex Process is substantially lower than that required for conventional air atmosphere fluidised bed reactions and as such, operating costs are reduced and profitability increased.The Minex Process is largely dry, so does not produce large tailings or waste ponds which need to be managed.  The waste product from the Minex Process is environmentally stable so waste management and mitigation costs are significantly reduced and the Minex waste can be used in secondary industries such as road building or ferro concrete production.The Minex Process has been developed by a team of highly respected companies under the overall project management of SRK Consulting. The Minex Process is patented in most of the major mining and metal processing countries.

SAPA GROUP OF COMPANIES LTD,1-10 employees, "The SCRIBENDUM record label is devoted to reissuing masterpieces and archive treasures from the Golden Age of the LPs, mainly through licensing deals with the copyrights owners.
SCRIBENDUM was formed in the year 2000. Initially distributed by SilverOak Music Entertainment, in 2004 it was acquired by Giorgio Cuppini, formerly head of EMI Classics Italy, a veteran of the music industry for over 30 years and who subsequently founded SCRIBENDUM LTD.
SCRIBENDUM’s choice of repertoire is dictated primarily by those most fine and intense recordings and performances sought after by discerning collectors and classical music lovers who demand high quality recordings, selected repertoire and stunning original artwork design.
Where possible, original artwork is used along with original sound sources. For the digital re-mastering SCRIBENDUM chooses world class studios, such as Abbey Road, Giraffe Production and 10th Planet D.M.
Many of the recordings released by SCRIBENDUM have been awarded prestigious acknowledgments, including the Diapason d’Or, Gramophone Choice and 10 of Repertoire.
SCRIBENDUM focuses on quality rather than quantity and this is why its releases are limited to a carefully selected number of master recordings in single or boxed set formats, with the purpose of keeping such masterpieces alive and recognizable amongst the plethora of chaotic themed and un-themed releases that flood the modern market.
SCRIBENDUM maintains that music is an Art and as such treats its “products” with respect and not as if handling and selling tins of tuna.
Our record label, “SCRIBENDUM”, derives its name from the Latin verb, “scribere”, meaning, “to write”.
“SCRIBENDUM”, describes something that one ought to write and it is therefore a creative direction, exhorting us to go and record (write down) the great masterpieces in recorded music that might otherwise be lost.

SILICON REEF LTD,11-50 employees, "SkillsForge is a business which delivers a software as a service cloud based solution to universities across the world. The SkillsForge business provides enabling technologies from the cloud to improve and automate university processes. On top of this, equally valuable, SkillsForge dramatically increases the breadth, depth and sophistication of business intelligence reporting for universities.
The engagement model commences with expert consultation, where we seek to tailor, through configuration, SkillsForge for university clients. Whereas each instance of SkillsForge looks very different, from the University of Adelaide to Kings College London, it is the same ''under the hood''.  SkillsForge integrates easily with existing university systems so data can be shared between systems and enormous levels of data warehoused by SkillsForge, for subsequent business intelligence reporting.
The SkillsForge solution is hosted at Amazon Web Services across the world with instances currently in London and Sydney serving the UK and Australian markets respectively. The universities in these countries use SkillsForge as follows:- management of the student journey from registration through to examination- skills assessment, tracking and development needs analysis- short course and event booking and management including all development activity recording
The use of SkillsForge delivers to universities the holy grail of massive cost savings AND transformational business intelligence insights.
Whereas the main focus is on the deployment of the cloud solution and integrating it with existing university systems, the first step is for the expert, experienced SkillsForge team to consult with the university to discuss and gather enough information to tailor (through configuration) the SkillsForge solution to the desired client specific instance.  
SkillsForge is paid for through an up front charge for the configuration and implementation effort and an annual license fee.

SOCIETY OF MARITIME INDUSTRIES LIMITED,Advanced manufacturing, "In addition, we have achieved “carbon negative” status for the production of our composite decking system.

Results showed that production of ecodek® actually had a net effect of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere rather than adding to it – hence carbon negative – a huge achievement in modern manufacturing and one that clearly illustrates our company’s environmental credentials.
As a manufacturer of a range of products made from 95% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable, Ecodek by its very nature is a champion of sustainability.

STUART GROUP LIMITED,Security, "swIDch aims to eliminate digital identity-related fraud through our patented algorithm OTAC™ (One-Time Authentication Code). It generates a dynamic code that never duplicates and simultaneously supports identification and authentication of the user/device with the code alone, and can do so without a network connection. And because it’s a single-use, time-based code that’s unique to the user/device, there is no risk of hacking or hijacking. 
This is the world’s first one-way dynamic authentication technology that can identify users with the code alone, which used to be considered impossible before swIDch. It overcomes the limitations of existing authentication methods such as ID/PW, OTP and tokens: It significantly reduces user friction by seamlessly removing authentication steps in existing systems as opposed to adding them as is the current industry standard. Moreover, other solutions in the market still require an active network connection to provide their authentication services whereas OTAC™ does not.

STUART SCOTT ASSOCIATES LIMITED,11-50 employees, "Imagine knowing in advance what each of your consumers will buy next, and be able to present those products to them at exactly the right time. This is predictive personalisation. SwiftERM, the on-trend personalisation SaaS, delivers as much as 20x the return of segmenting, triggered and omnichannel software combined. Using a predictive analytics algorithm on all the data captured on your site, it calculates which products are most likely to be bought next by each individual consumer, and presents these products remotely.  
Analysing impressions and buying history, it ranks all your SKUs in order of the greatest buying propensity for each individual consumer. However, unlike software that tailors a landing page, in the hope your consumer comes to you (instead of a competitor), SwiftERM sends each consumer their own unique product selection, always those with the greatest buying propensity for that individual. If you have an ESP, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, Emarsys etc, it works alongside it. 
What does it achieve?This is big-data technology. It delivers an average ROI in excess of 1500%. (Verifiable stats across all existing users). 
Predictive personalisation is the highest achieving Martech solution. SwiftERM, with zero segmentation, and sits at the very top. This is a must have addition for all sites where consumers return frequently – Fashion, Grocery, Wine, Beauty, Petfood, Cycling etc.
Without it, revenue from even your most loyal consumers, is going elsewhere. This is a 100% automatic solution – zero human involvement ever, delivering the maximum GP! You are invited to establish viability risk free with a 30-day FREE trial.

SUSSEX FIREPLACE GALLERY,1-10 employees, "SafeCast is the trading name for this UK limited company which we co-founded in 2013. This was in anticipation of the grant of the SafeCast patent. SafeCast is a means of ensuring that inappropriate advertisements are not shown to children or vulnerable people. As we developed the technology we found that our invention could also be used outside of the patent’s claims to filter all video content free of charge.  This discovery enabled us to explore in detail how our invention could be used for universal child protection purposes rather than just in the advertising industry.
We have consulted widely with children’s advocates, children’s charities, mental health and welfare agencies, government departments and regulators, police and teachers as well as with the broadcasters, advertisers and social media companies in the UK and in the USA. Through our extensive research and our published evidence to the UK Government and the European Commission we established that the internet does not have a universal means by which content can be safely filtered away from children who might otherwise have been harmed by it. Whilst there are a variety of proprietary apps, parental controls and Age Verification Services which can be used by parents to protect their children to a limited extent,  the regulatory patchwork of national legislation means that there is currently no overarching means of protecting children without censorship. SafeCast’s universal labelling system with its automatic filtering provides this.
We are Alistair Kelman,  the CEO of Safecast, and Diana Kelman, the Project Director of SafeCast. SafeCast’s Non-Executive Director is Henning von Spreckelsen. SafeCast has also set up SafeCast Global which is an Anglo-Australian initiative that is managed by us and Giulio Giampellegrini, who is SafeCast Global’s integrated marketing communication specialist based in Australia.

SYNOVUM LIMITED,1-10 employees, "ShoeStix was the brainchild of Sheila Rowan, a 57 year-old mother of four. Sheila had always been frustrated with shoe slipping and, more specifically, the quality of the products available in stores - nothing worked. This was a view echoed by her friends and sisters. Having recently stepped down from the recruitment agency that she founded over 30 years ago, Sheila discussed the possibility of manufacturing something new with her son, Sean.
Sean was working in advertising at the time whilst growing his own small events company, Zorball. He set about finding a manufacturer for what would become known as ShoeStix. Following 6 months of prototyping and market research, ShoeStix was publicly launched in June 2016. 
Feedback from trialists and customers continues to demonstrate what a superb product ShoeStix is. The mother-and-son team are of the firm assertion that ShoeStix is superior to all related products. 
ShoeStix are currently being sold directly from www.ShoeStix.com, in several online marketplaces and in numerous shoe stores and pharmacies in the UK. They are currently looking for buyers in the UK and overseas in the fashion, footwear and pharmaceutical industries.

Sagegreen Consulting Ltd,Food and drink, "The Summerdown Story – and how Black Mitcham peppermint came home 
As a family the Colmans have always been drawn to robust, piercing flavours. For years it was mustard, but 25 years ago they turned their tastes to mint.
Back in 1995, Sir Michael Colman and his farm manger Ian set their sights on America to track down Black Mitcham peppermint – a notoriously tricky herb to grow and one which had, 100 years before, been native to England. 
Struck by the overwhelmingly intense, nostalgic flavour of this peppermint, Ian and Sir Michael decided to take a few cuttings back home, and have a go at cultivating them.
After a lot of research, advice and a good bit of patience, they started by planting a plot the size of a tennis court. And, over time, those peppermint plants slowly started to establish themselves in the soil at Summerdown.
Skip forward a few decades to today and we now grow over 100 acres of English peppermint, transforming it into the world’s purest peppermint oil, which we use in everything we make. We also sell this oil directly to our favourite makers so that they can use it in their collections too. We’ve become ‘The Peppermint people’.
What’s more, every single one of our peppermint plants is related to those original cuttings taken by Sir Michael and has fully acclimatised to our environment. That’s why the flavour and aroma you get from Summerdown Mint is so refined – and completely unique.

TEN INTELLIGENCE LIMITED,11-50 employees, "Bio-D launched over 25 years ago, after our founder Michael Barwell – who used to clean ships for a living - realised that many home cleaning products contained the same ingredients as the industrial cleaners he used at work; products which required the use of heavy-duty health and safety equipment such as respirators. Horrified, he set out to create products that contained no harmful ingredients, and Bio-D was born. 
The entire Bio-D range, from our All Purpose Sanitiser to Laundry Liquid, is made wholly by us, at our premises in Hull, East Yorkshire. Our products are made from naturally-derived raw materials, are completely free from synthetic fragrances, preservatives and enzymes, and use recycled and recyclable packaging.
Our range is 100% hypoallergenic and approved by the Vegan Society and Cruelty Free International, while our fragrance free laundry products are approved by Allergy UK too, providing extra peace of mind for those with sensitive skin and conditions such as eczema and asthma.
What’s more, if every household in the UK used Bio-D laundry products instead of ‘regular’ alternatives, they would each save a staggering 2.5 million litres of water a year! That’s because 67% less water is required to purify the waste from Bio-D laundry products compared to ‘regular’ products, due to the natural ingredients that the Bio-D range contains.

TERRAMAR NETWORKS LIMITED,1-10 employees, "We craft a range of natural, innovative ciders that are different because of their authentic full flavours and quirky contemporary designs that give them lots of playful personality and crowd-pleasing character. 
The emphasis is on the natural flavours of our bittersweet cider apples, so it is important we use the right ingredients and not to rush the fermentation or maturation processes. 
We only ever ferment from 100% cider apple juice sourced from around our region - we don't use apple concentrates, nor add sugar or increase temperature at fermentation, or any artificial process that might affect the fresh full flavours of our apples. 
The result is a rare full-bodied richness that remains true to our apples and has an integrity of flavour.
We aim to broaden the appeal of natural real cider and make drinks that can appreciated over a whole evening by a wide range of people, so we avoid unnecessarily high alcoholic drinks. 
The playful personalities come from the names and designs we use on our ciders, so bottled products are NoBrainer, SideBurns, SweetCheeks and BlowHorn. They all come in 330ml as well as 500ml bottles and have a strong stand-out appeal both on shop shelves and in bars.  
We also have a range of draught ciders with colourful names and expressions too - YellowHammer, Muscle Mary, She Devil, Freak Show and Voodoo Pulp.
All the ciders provide bar owners with a different and appealing cider offer to their customers who recognise the original and distinctive expressions of the flavours and stylish, characterful designs.
We supply to national bar chains like Brewdog, BrewHouse and Kitchen etc and exclusive London restaurants like The Hawksmoor Group, Dishoom Restaurant, and Harvey Nichols. We also export to Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden etc. 
We are happy to provide more information as required - please see our full company presentation on our website at www.cotswoldciderco.com

TESSELLATE DESIGN STUDIO LTD,11-50 employees, "The Cotswolds Distillery was founded in 2014 by Dan Szor. A native New Yorker, Dan had been working in finance in London and spending his weekends with his family in the Cotswolds. He had been looking for a new direction that would let him move permanently to the countryside and do something he was passionate about. A dedicated whisky fan, Dan saw the fields of golden barley around his house in the Cotswolds and had a brainwave “I suddenly thought, there’s barley all over the Cotswolds and nobody’s distilling it, let’s be the first!”Production began in September 2014, just a few months after the distillery was commissioned. Since then we have produced a number of different spirits and liqueurs, from absinthe to a rye whisky, whilst also steadily increasing production of our Cotswolds Single Malt Whisky and the Cotswolds Dry Gin. It has been an incredible journey so far, and we are looking forward to many years ahead producing our Outstanding Natural Spirits.
The Cotswolds Dry Gin is an aromatic twist on a classic London Dry; light hints of lavender, lots of zesty citrus notes with cooling, piney juniper and bay leaf. Over 10x the average weight of botanicals go into each run of the traditional copper pot still, producing a richly flavoured London Dry. No chill-filtering takes place, and only naturally filtered water is then added – so when ice or tonic meets the gin, the essential oils from the nine botanicals will form a beautiful pearlescent haze. Robust, fresh and perfectly balanced – this is a traditional gin with a memorable twist. 
The first whisky ever to be distilled in the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Cotswolds Single Malt Whisky is a rich and fruity single malt.It has been bottled non-chill filtered and at 46% ABV. Made from 100% locally grown, floor-malted barley; the distillers have used long fermentations, unusual yeast strains and innovative distillation cuts to achieve a spirit that is smooth, fruity & balanced.

THE COTSWOLD DISTILLING COMPANY LIMITED,51-200 employees, "The Lake District has long been a crucible for creativity, a place in which the imagination can flourish, and it’s no different for The Lakes Distillery. The nature of their art is whisky, and their inspiration is the natural beauty of the UNESCO World Heritage Site where a state-of-the-art distillery has been built meticulously within a 160-year-old farmstead on the banks of the River Derwent.
Respecting tradition but not being hampered by it, The Lakes' whiskymaker works across what seem to be two very different disciplines, that of the artist and the scientist. Under Dhavall Gandhi’s guidance, the idea of distilling being distinct individual elements is not how they look at the art. Rather it is part of a continuum, a net of possibilities where everything is interlinked. Change one element and the effect will change everything else.
Only by understanding how flavours are created throughout the spirit’s journey through the distillery can a whiskymaker fully comprehend the possibilities. That is why, unusually, Dhavall is actively involved at every stage. It is holistic whisky-making, to ensure every flavour possibility is achieved.
Fermentation and distillation, with the luxury of time, create a vibrant and fruity spirit with enough body to handle maturation in ex-sherry casks, in which 80-90% of The Lakes’ spirit is filled. Made from American, Spanish or French oak, in different sizes, the casks are seasoned with Fino and Pedro Ximenez, as well as Oloroso sherry. This sets The Lakes apart.
By knowing each cask intimately; how the flavours are evolving and then how they can be blended with others to complement, enhance, deepen, broaden or contrast, The Lakes’ whiskymaker hand-selects the final casks, which are allowed to marry together for up to a year before bottling. 
With over 100,000 visitors a year, The Lakes Distillery also produces The Lakes Gin and  The Lakes Vodka, crowned ‘World’s Best Vodka’ at the 2019 World Vodka Awards.

THE EYE GLASS HOLDING CO LTD,1-10 employees, "Low Beat Music is music that has a beat of 60 beats a minute or less.
Just as music can energize when we play fast music at The Low beat Music Company we believe that music of 60 beats per minute or less can help people in multiple ways. This can be by inducing sleep, help recall of information for exam taking, and enhanced learning, as well as, eliminating stress.
Low beat music can relax and calm people but it also produces Alpha brain waves. These are the same brain waves that occur when hypnotized or when meditation. The difference is that with our music you do not need to be “induced” by a hypnotist or spend years learning meditation techniques. You can control the process yourself because it is a natural effect. Our music is created by Robin Black, who has 35 years experience in the Music Business and is trained in meditation techniques. He has worked with artists such as Pink Floyd, Paul McCartney, Jethro Tull, Cat Stevens, Steeley Span and Alice Cooper. This music is created using sophisticated equipment that ensures all the elements remain below 60 beats per minute

THE GREAT BRITISH CONFECTIONERS LIMITED,Food and drink, "Hamish, a wine merchant, began to pursue his lifelong passion for plants by gaining a Herbology Diploma.  Along with his wife Liberty they dreamed of a secret herb garden, a place where people could open the door to the magic of nature.
2011 saw the dream become a reality when the transformation began of an overgrown seven acre lowland site on the outskirts of Edinburgh.
In 2014 The Secret Herb Garden opened its doors to the public becoming a destination wedding venue, local arts centre, shop and café. Today The Secret Herb Garden is an award-winning herb nursery with over 600 naturally grown and tended varieties of herbs and flowers.
As well as providing top Edinburgh restaurants with unique natural ingredients. In 2017 The Old Curiosity Distillery was born and Hamish embarked on the production of a collection of premium, 100% natural, hand crafted gins, produced using the herbs and flowers from The Secret Herb Garden. Passionate about his garden, Hamish’s motivation was to make use of the plants, botanicals, and flowers that he grows, and to create Gins that are entirely natural with no additives or flavourings.
The Secret Garden 100% natural gins are now multi-award winning and stocked by the UK’s most prestigious retailers and exported to some 10 countries around the globe.

THINK2READ,1-10 employees, "TORS Vodka was created by two childhood friends who grew up together in the heart of Devon, England. 
Vodka became our social groups’ drink of choice, and so our product of choice was an easy one. 
With this in mind, the pathway to creating a smooth tasting, British Vodka that could be drunk neat was set. 
It took us just shy of three years to craft our Vodka. We use a British soft winter wheat spirit, blended with Dartmoor spring water, which we then charcoal filter for up to 3 months. 
We were confident that we had developed a truly unique and delicious product; however the true test of quality would come from entering the ‘Taste of the West’ awards. We have entered in both 2018, and 2019, and are immensely proud to have achieved ‘GOLD’ both years. 
We are extremely grateful to each and every one of our customers who have supported us on this exciting journey. It is because of you we have continued challenging ourselves to create new and exciting products to enjoy, which feature our award winning Vodka at its core. 
Our Cocktail Liqueur range has been created by blending our choice of fresh ingredients with our delicious Vodka. We set out to make Cocktail Liqueurs that can be simply added with one mixer to create premium standard cocktails. Although they taste pretty good on the rocks too! They can be enjoyed at home, or by the most demanding mixologist. We hope you enjoy them as much as we have enjoyed creating them.

Pablo Picasso used to eat it on a daily basis to aid his concentration. Both Winston Churchill and Napoleon were considered admirers of the delicacy.
Zeynep Turudi, founder of Truede wanted to bring this delicacy to the UK: ‘With Turkish roots, my parents always brought back real Turkish Delight to the UK to give to all our friends and neighbours. I decided to research the UK market to see if there was a gap in the market for a quality Turkish Delight brand, which of course there was.’ We use authentic recipes, some of which date back over 500 years. These recipes also have the benefit of being made from natural ingredients.
However we didn’t just stop at Turkish Delight, our luxury confectionery products are equally important to us. From our chocolate spoons, to new delights such as our nut selection boxes and chickpeas, we want everyone to be able to enjoy our variety of mouth-watering flavours. Our aim is to provide high quality confectionery for health conscious consumers worldwide.

TXTLOCAL LIMITED,1-10 employees, "The Scottish Bee Company was founded by Iain and Suzie Millar in 2017. They felt strongly about the UK’s declining bee population and decided to do something to help. 
Their passion and determination prompted them to adopt some bees, hire a team of expert bee farmers and brought them together in the heather covered hills of Scotland to produce uniquely flavorful honeys that evoke a sense of Scotland’s unspoiled wilderness.
The company's heather honey was revealed as a world-leading superfood in a recent scientific study.  Researchers from Fera Science Limited teamed up with the Scottish Bee Company to undertake a scientific study into the nutritional content of the firm's honey.  The study showed that The Scottish Bee Company’s heather honey contains up to 10 times more of the essential micronutrient, manganese, compared to 200 of its global rivals.
It is also the first honey in the UK to acheive internationally recognised accreditation standards for quality and provenance.
The Scottish Bee Company currently export to Europe, North America and the Far East.

The Halo Media Group,1-10 employees, "Tuk Tuk Chai is the first and only ready-to-drink iced milk tea, or authentic brewed chai. We follow the traditional recipes and brewing techniques used by the chaiwallahs of India to brew our chai: we brew black tea leaves (sourced from Kerala) with milk, water, and optional spices. Our chai is available in three distinct flavours: Original, Spicy Masala and Aromatic Cardamom. Available in 250 ml, Tuk Tuk Chai can be drunk cold on the go or hot, used as a mixer in cocktails or as an ingredient in desserts.
Since launching in 2017, Tuk Tuk Chai has received many accolades: we were finalists of Virgin Foodpreneur 2017! where the judges looked for the best and brightest food and drinks startups in the UK. Tuk Tuk Chai was also voted most innovative product at the prestigious Lunch!2017 trade show. In August 2018, Tuk Tuk Chai pitched to the Dragons on Dragons Den: they praised the taste of our chai, our brand and our business. As a result, we received an investment offer from Peter Jones for the total sum of £100,000. However we mutually decided to part ways after careful consideration. Instead, we chose to turn to the public and undertake a crowdfunding campaign. It was a real success with 400 investors joining Tuk Tuk Chai and raising £276,000 by the end of the campaign. We now have investors from the UK and beyond with a fair number of them based in the Middle East.
Upon launching at the International Food and Drinks Exhibition (IFE 2017) in London, Tuk Tuk Chai created a genuine buzz and raised a lot of interest from buyers abroad. General feedback was overwhelmingly positive about our product, and particularly its unique taste, our innovation in the tea market (as it is brewed tea with milk) and our branding.

Trade Finance Global,1-10 employees, "Ultramed, is an award-winning company founded in 2014 by Dr Paul Upton and Alan Sanders. Paul worked clinically for over 30 years in the NHS as an anaesthetist and later a Medical Director. Alan is a Creative Director, and owner of a high-end digital production company. Out of the combination of clinical leadership and design expertise has come Ultramed, providing ‘health technology for people’. Ultramed has developed a suite of programs, used in the preparation of patients for procedures and operations. Ultramed provides cloud-hosted health technology placing innovation and first-class patient experience at the forefront of strategy. There are 10 million procedures, such as operations and endoscopies, performed in the NHS each year. Pre-procedure assessments are generally paper-based which is time consuming and expensive. A DoH Digital QIPP study predicted £65M p.a. savings if electronic preoperative assessments are used. MyPreOp® is the flagship program, allowing patients to enter, own and share their information with their hospital from any device. MyPreOp® can be completed as a one-stop preoperative assessment following a surgical outpatient appointment or inputted by the patient from home. An electronic report is sent securely to the hospital to integrate into the EPR, using HL7 messaging and SNOMED-CT coded data. MyPreOp® is powered by complex algorithms which underpin the future development of a Personal Health Record. Sophisticated clinical decision support suggests which preoperative tests and actions should be considered by the assessment nurse. Over 5000 patients have successfully used MyPreOp® in commercial trials in the NHS and a UK private hospital. The cloud-hosted programs are easy to set up in different countries, we are looking for health software distributors with access into non-UK markets. The distributors will have excellent access into their marketplace and be familiar with health IT software and integration between different systems.

Trowers & Hamlins LLP,11-50 employees, "Underground – a sub-culture champion that was born out of a love of renegade style
Manchester, 1981. A city in the North of England, at that time  bleak and depressed from industrial decline. Yet there remained a defiant, relentless creativity from the true melting pot of sub-cultures that co-existed there. 
Punks, Post Punks, Gothics, New Romantics and Football Casuals and even remnants of Northern Soul co-habited in the city. Up until that point, even up to the current day, it was a rare anomaly to find those sub-cultures in one place, at  one time. Underground was born at the exact right moment, in the exact right place.
From what seemed a doomed landscape, Underground’s beginnings stem modestly from a store in the heart of Manchester. 
Looking beyond Manchester, the brand watched the evolution of the movements across the UK,  notably in London's neighbourhood of Camden. 1987, and our first full collection, now known as our Originals, hit the market. Inspired by the ferocity of punk and its febrile aftermath, Underground's Originals collection became a mainstay for New Romantics, Goths and New Wavers during the late 1980's.
As Post Punk gave way to the grunge of the 1990's, Underground's steel cap boots found favour in North America, Europe and Japan.
In the following 2010+ years, the Original Underground Creeper asserted itself as an archetype. It was Underground that held the Creeper style aloft and no doubt brought it back to the centre stage in 2011. The Underground Creeper went from being ridiculed to transforming yet again into the favoured shoe for tastemakers across the globe.
The distinctive silhouette with which the brand became synonymous found its way to new products, including Jungle and Nox. These designs in themselves have a lineage right back to the brands' early Manchester days.

These activities, which continue to this day, are invaluable in terms of market knowledge and understanding the vertical farming market. 
The transition into technology occurred in 2018 as the company sought new systems to support with expansion - a process that ended without success, pushing the company into technology development. Several years were spent developing, testing, and commercialising numerous hardware and software solutions that tackle various existing market and technology failures in the vertical farming market. 
Following a 'soft' launch of its technologies in Summer 2020 (during COVID), Vertical Future has generated a substantial global pipeline and now has build projects from the UK, to the Caribbean, to Singapore. The Company's model is to sell its hardware and to license its software, generating a long-term relationship focused on data and optimisation.

WATERHAUL LTD,Security, "Formed in 1993 as a specialist vacuum engineering company to provide custom made medium and high vacuum systems, the company rapidly developed its business and within a few years had established an unrivalled reputation for innovative design and manufacture of a broad range of custom vacuum systems.
The demand for these systems came from a wide range of industrial and academic customers, including many blue-chip companies and world-leading universities.
In 1996, West Technology was invited by a leading establishment for forensic research and development to take a fresh look at the Vacuum Metal Deposition (VMD) technique, in light of new process developments and an outdated range of aging VMD systems that could not meet the demands of the modern forensic laboratory. This led to the introduction in 1998 of our VMD900 system. This system quickly became the standard system throughout the UK and established West Technology in the forensic market.
Our continued commitment to improving our VMD systems, with the goal of making this powerful process more accessible to police forces and forensic laboratories around the world, has led to many product innovations, including the launch of the compact VMD560 in 2009, the introduction of the world’s first ever bench top VMD system – the VMD360 in 2014 and most recently the VMD1260.
West Technology is committed to using its specialist knowledge of vacuum technology and our passion for vacuum engineering, to create new, exciting products for use by forensic providers.
West Technology is an ISO9001:2015 accredited company.

With a background in engineering and over 15 years of experience working in some of the high tech companies around the world, Maria, the co-founder, found a new passion on child development after becoming a first time parent. How children learn and grow is fascinating. Her aha moment was when she realised that children learn with their bodies before they can learn with their brains! With Capikooa, Maria and Warren want to nurture children's development through play and encourage life skills like creativity, critical thinking and movement. At the same time as creating a circular product from design to help protect our planet. 
Capikooa (Cap-Ee-Koo-Ah)First ‘Young & Learning’ re-branded in November 2020 to better represent products which are beneficial to the whole child (from mind to body).
Reflecting Maria’s Spanish origin, we were inspired by words from Valenciano and Catalan. ‘Cap’ meaning ‘head’ and ‘Cua’ tai meaning ‘tail’ (head to tail). We’ve tweaked the spelling so the phrase can be pronounced both in Spanish and English.
Our new name is also a lot more fun to say, and we’re all about more fun!

We specialise in organising English seasonal schools in the UK for students from Mainland China and Taiwan, 'Summer Abroad' programmes for students from the UK, school-to-school exchange programmes, and long-term school-to-school partnerships.
Over the course of running our Summer and Winter School programmes, we have taken hundreds of children on their first-ever trip abroad, giving them a life-changing and eye-opening experience, and countless opportunities to meet and bond with students from a totally different background.
Our school-to-school programme focuses on connecting like-minded institutions and organising events and programmes that are in-keeping with their own specialisms, ethos, and goals. In particular, our highly-successful 'Busy Bi' Pen Pal programme ('Bi' [''bee''] being the Chinese word for ''pen'') links students directly, helping them take the first steps to breaking down cultural divides. Many of these students then get the chance to meet their Pen Pal in person on a Yo-Yo-organised exchange trip - always a moving experience never to be forgotten. 
Yo-Yo School Exchange also arranges ''Summer Abroad'' programmes in China for children from the UK aged 14-17. This is a unique programme that combines a mixture of language classes, tourist excursions, and activities with local students (all from Yo-Yo School Exchange's extensive network of partner schools across the country). This programme offers students the chance to become truly immersed, turbo-charging their language skills and understanding, kick-starting their international careers.
Our primary goal is to give children from both sides the chance to meet counterparts from the other side of the world, to discover a new culture, and form friendships and bonds that will last long after their initial exchange experience.

Frill is a product in a league of its own. It’s not an ice-cream and it’s not a yoghurt, it’s simply and deliciously, a frozen smoothie. Frill is made from a delicious blend of sun-ripened fruits and veggies, with no dairy, no added sugar or sweetener and no gluten, and yet it has a smooth and creamy texture - this is where the brilliance comes in. Frill invented a special churning process that ensures every bite is filled with healthy indulgence. In fact, our fruit and vegetables are picked ripe (more flavour and vitamins) and immediately frozen to preserve all nutrients. 
We have four flavours to choose from, Intense Chocolate, Nutty Caramel, Bursting Berries and Refreshing Green, all of which have 10x the fibre of your typical ice-cream. Whether you are a chocolate lover or a green smoothie enthusiast, Frill has something delicious and healthy for everyone. Frill is diverse in its flavour profile and in the way you can enjoy it too. Have Frill straight from the tub, as a morning smoothie, in a cocktail or even in a salad dressing; we simply do the crafting and leave the eating to you. 
Frill has two manufacturers, one in south-east London that caters to our European market, and another in California that caters to our U.S. market. Frill is available to order direct or through one of our distributors, and is available in two different tub sizes: 500ml and 120ml. 
We are open to white labels, interested in exporting our product, and in the business of creating a multinational brand.
