## The project is made for an Upwork user who needed someone to collect the data of 3482 companies from an [online website](https://www.great.gov.uk/international/trade/search/?industries=AEROSPACE&industries=ADVANCED_MANUFACTURING&industries=AIRPORTS&industries=AGRICULTURE_HORTICULTURE_AND_FISHERIES&industries=AUTOMOTIVE&industries=BIOTECHNOLOGY_AND_PHARMACEUTICALS&industries=BUSINESS_AND_CONSUMER_SERVICES&industries=CHEMICALS&industries=CLOTHING_FOOTWEAR_AND_FASHION&industries=COMMUNICATIONS&industries=CONSTRUCTION&industries=CREATIVE_AND_MEDIA&industries=EDUCATION_AND_TRAINING&industries=ELECTRONICS_AND_IT_HARDWARE&industries=ENVIRONMENT&industries=FINANCIAL_AND_PROFESSIONAL_SERVICES&industries=FOOD_AND_DRINK&industries=GIFTWARE_JEWELLERY_AND_TABLEWARE&industries=GLOBAL_SPORTS_INFRASTRUCTURE&industries=HEALTHCARE_AND_MEDICAL&industries=HOUSEHOLD_GOODS_FURNITURE_AND_FURNISHINGS&industries=LIFE_SCIENCES&industries=LEISURE_AND_TOURISM&industries=LEGAL_SERVICES&industries=MARINE&industries=MECHANICAL_ELECTRICAL_AND_PROCESS_ENGINEERING&industries=METALLURGICAL_PROCESS_PLANT&industries=METALS_MINERALS_AND_MATERIALS&industries=MINING&industries=OIL_AND_GAS&industries=PORTS_AND_LOGISTICS&industries=POWER&industries=RAILWAYS&industries=RENEWABLE_ENERGY&industries=RETAIL_AND_LUXURY&industries=SECURITY&industries=SOFTWARE_AND_COMPUTER_SERVICES&industries=TEXTILES_INTERIOR_TEXTILES_AND_CARPETS&industries=WATER&page=1).

I used Python language (along with BeautifulSoup library) to automatically collect exactly the desired data about **3457** companies, leaving only 25 companies to manual data extraction, and the whole process took less than 9 hours.

Although my bid wasn't chosen by the user, I did it anyways to practice my BeautifulSoup skills, and I succeeded.

## The success rate is **99.3%**, and the results file is [here](Results.xlsx).
